# GBPyro

Galactic binaries in LISA with Pyro.  Note: I was having trouble with
[Pyro](https://pyro.ai), and ended up switching to [PyMC3](https://docs.pymc.io)
for the sampling for this project.  Turned out the problems were mine, but
sticking with the working code; so the repo name is unfortunate.
